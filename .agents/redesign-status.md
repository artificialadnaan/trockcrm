# Redesign Status

> Living coordination doc. Each agent: read before claiming, write a line when claiming or releasing. Use 24h-clock UTC timestamps.
>
> **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ [agent-label] STATUS — short description (PR #__ if open)`
>
> **STATUS values:** `CLAIM` / `WIP` / `BLOCKED` / `PR-OPEN` / `MERGED` / `ABANDONED`
>
> **Rules:**
> - Append-only. Never edit another agent's line.
> - One line per sub-PR (a track can have multiple sub-PRs in flight).
> - Releasing a claim without finishing → write an `ABANDONED` line with reason. Don't silently disappear.
> - Stale claims (>24h with no follow-up) may be reclaimed after the human confirms.
> - Human is the final referee.
